# Pipetionary - Privacy Policy

Effective date: 2026-02-22

This Privacy Policy explains how Pipetionary handles information. Pipetionary is a reference app for piping data and technical terms, designed to run on-device without user accounts.

## Summary
- No account creation and no sign-in.
- No ads.
- No collection of names, emails, or contact information through the app.
- Core app features (catalog browsing, dictionary lookup, and calculations) run locally on your device.
- If future versions introduce online features, analytics, or new permissions, this policy will be updated before release.

## Data Collection and Sharing
- **Personal data**: Pipetionary does not collect personal contact data such as name, email address, or phone number through app usage.
- **App usage and crash data**: Pipetionary does not intentionally collect analytics or crash-reporting telemetry in normal use.
- **Identifiers**: Pipetionary does not intentionally create or transmit advertising identifiers for tracking.
- **Third-party sharing**: We do not sell your data and we do not share app inputs with third parties for advertising.

## On-Device Processing
Inputs and selections used in Pipetionary are processed locally on your device. Data such as favorites and recent lookups is stored locally to support app functionality.

## Permissions
Pipetionary is not designed to access contacts, camera, microphone, or precise location for its core functionality.

On Android, the app may declare certain system/network capabilities required by the framework and app runtime. These are not used to collect your personal contact data or to upload your engineering inputs to our servers.
