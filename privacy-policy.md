# Pump Mate – Privacy Policy

Effective date: 2026-01-19

This Privacy Policy explains how Pump Mate handles information. Pump Mate is a standalone calculator app designed to work without collecting personal data by default; however, persistent identifiers (e.g., Installation IDs), which may be classified as personal data, are collected only with your explicit consent (see the "Data Collection and Sharing" section).

## Summary
- No accounts, no sign‑in, and no ads.
- We do not collect names or contact info. Anonymous usage data is optional.
- All calculations run on your device; we do not operate backend services for this app.
- If future versions introduce online features or new permissions, this policy will be updated before release.

## Data Collection and Sharing
- **Personal Data**: We do not collect names, emails, or other personal contact information. However, if you consent to analytics, persistent identifiers (e.g., Installation ID) are collected and are treated as personal data under applicable privacy laws.
- **Usage Data & Crash Reporting**: We use **Firebase Analytics** and **Sentry** to collect usage data and crash reports to help us improve the app. This collection is **optional** and requires your explicit consent. Collected data includes:
    - Device type and OS version
    - App version
    - Session duration
    - Crash stack traces and app state
- **Identifiers**: If you consent, persistent identifiers (e.g., Installation ID) are stored to associate crash reports and maintain consent state.
- **Data Retention**: Analytics and crash data are retained for a limited period (e.g., 90 days for crash reports, 14 months for analytics) and then deleted or anonymized.
- **Third Parties**:
    - **Google Firebase**: [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)
    - **Sentry**: [Privacy Policy](https://sentry.io/privacy/)

### Your Rights
You have the right to access, delete, and request portability of your data. Please contact us at **el.pipero.app@gmail.com** to exercise these rights. You can also opt-out at any time in the app settings.

## Transparency & Control
- You will be asked for consent to enable analytics when you first launch the app.
- You can revoke this consent at any time, which will stop data collection and clear stored analytics identifiers.

## On‑Device Processing
All inputs (e.g., flow rate, head, fluid density, efficiencies) are processed locally on your device to compute engineering results. These inputs are not transmitted to us.

## Permissions
Pump Mate does not request access to contacts, location, camera, or microphone.

On Android, the app may declare basic operating system capabilities (e.g., network access) required by the framework. The app does not use these capabilities to collect personal data or to upload your inputs. Pump Mate does not access your personal photos, media, or files.

## Children's Privacy
Pump Mate is a professional/utility tool and is not directed to children. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.

## Changes to This Policy
We will post any changes to this page and update the effective date. Material changes will be communicated in the release notes.
