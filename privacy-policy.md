## Summary
- No accounts, no sign‑in, no analytics, and no ads.
- We do not collect, store, sell, or share personal data.
- All calculations run on your device; we do not operate backend services for this app.
- If future versions introduce online features or new permissions, this policy will be updated before release.

## Data Collection and Sharing

All inputs (e.g., flow rate, head, fluid density, efficiencies) are processed locally on your device to compute engineering results. These inputs are not transmitted to us.

## Permissions
